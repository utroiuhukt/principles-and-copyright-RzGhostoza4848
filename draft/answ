1-What are the "Four Freedoms" defined by the Free Software Foundation?
The "Four Freedoms" defined by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) are the foundation of free software. Freedom 0 is the freedom to use the program however you want, for any purpose.
Freedom 1 is the freedom to study how the program works and modify it to do what you want, which requires access to the source code. Freedom 2 is the freedom to distribute copies of the program to help others.
And Freedom 3 is the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others, so the whole community can benefit.
These freedoms ensure that the software is truly free and that users have control over it.

2-How does the GNU Manifesto justify the ethical importance of free software?
The GNU Manifesto, written by Richard Stallman, justifies the ethical importance of free software by arguing that software is not just a technical tool but a matter of freedom.
Stallman says that proprietary software (the kind that isn’t free) restricts users' freedom and creates unfair dependency.
He believes that sharing software is an ethical act, like helping your neighbor, and that knowledge should be free so everyone can learn and grow.
The GNU Manifesto defends free software as a way to promote collaboration and solidarity among people.


3-What is the difference between "open source" and "free software"?
Now, about the difference between "open source" and "free software", here’s the deal: Open source means you can view and modify the source code of a program,
but it doesn’t always guarantee the full freedoms that free software offers. It’s like they give you access to the code, but with some restrictions. On the other hand,
free software goes further: not only does it let you view and modify the code, but it also gives you the freedom to use, share, and distribute it without restrictions. 
It’s like open source is halfway there, and free software is the full journey with all the freedoms.
Free software has a more ethical focus, promoting freedom and community, while open source is more about the practical benefits of having access to the code.
